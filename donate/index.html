Contributions are actively encouraged!

IMPORTANT: When building site with Jekyll, use this command (use bash on windows):
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build

Please let's have a culture of attribution, especially with pictures.

The way I do it:

1 - Use title attribute to display CC info on mouse_hover, example:
		title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"

2 - Link to original image with attribute target="blank", full example:
 		<a href="https://flic.kr/p/Rd94j6" target="blank"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Bridges not Walls" title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"/></a>

        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>
          We are the Community building the FluffyCat Donation Application, <a href="https://fluffycat.tech">the platform</a>. Our system will make it possible for nonprofits and individuals to unite and make the world a better place, by enabling full transparency and accountability towards Givers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are the primordial Decentralized Altruistic Community (DAC), we are the FluffyCat Kittens, the first users of our own platform and as every DAC, we need Donations to support us. You could be this Donator!.
        </p>
        <h3>Why donate to FluffyCat?</h3>
        <p>
          As opposed to traditional charity, with FluffyCat every donation and pledge is transparent, so you always know <strong>exactly</strong> where your donation went and get a good sense of the impact it made in direct communication with your beneficiary.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <ul class="flex-row d-flex features">
      <li>
        <h5>Is Giveth recognized as an official charity? </h5>
        <p>
          Giveth is a
          <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4">
            Decentralized Altruistic Community</a>
          and is not a registered as a charitable entity, we are however registered on the blockchain ;-) We are a community-led project and will not derive any direct profit from the platform. We strive to
          <a href="http://wiki.fluffycat.tech/dac/about/">model the DAC concept </a>
          as one of the first not-for-profit blockchain based entities. We guarantee all funds will get recycled back into the Community that is ensuring the Giveth Platform gets adopted widely.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>What is the roadmap for the Giveth Platform? </h5>
        <p>
          The roadmap for the Giveth DApp can be found <a href="http://wiki.fluffycat.tech/documentation/product-roadmap/">here</a>.
          <br>
          As a Giver you can also ask us for an exclusive tour of the DApp in which The Giveth DAC, Campaigns plus Milestones are visible. These are updated continuously.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>I still need more detail on how Giveth works, where can I find this? </h5>
        <p>
          You can read a <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4">general overview</a> of how the Donation Application works or read more about it in our <a href="https://wiki.fluffycat.tech/documentation/product-definition/">product definition</a>. If you want to discover our other activities, do browse our Wiki or reach out to us on <a href="../join">Slack or Riot!</a>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>How do the Giveth Governance Tokens work and how do I get these? </h5>
        <p>
          We accept ETH, BTC and any Ethereum based tokens directly, but if you donate ETH from MEW, Metamask, Mist or Parity you'll receive Giveth Governance Tokens (GGT) in return!
          <br>
          When you donate you receive Giveth Governance Tokens, which will be in control of the platform once we are full on decentralized. Contact us on <a href="../join">Slack or Riot</a> if you have any doubts.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Where can I see in detail what you are spending donations on? </h5>
        <p>
          One of the core values of Giveth is transparency. We invite everyone to have a look at our <a href="http://wiki.fluffycat.tech/dac/finances/">finances</a>.
          <br>
          As a Giver you can also ask us for an exclusive tour of the DApp in which The Giveth DAC, Campaigns plus Milestones Ã nd the funds linked to these are visible onto a very granular level. In the near future access to the DApp will be opened up to the wider public.

        </p>

      <li>
        <h5>I like your project but right now I have no funds to donate, how else can I contribute? </h5>
        <p>
          We are a very inclusive Community and would love your help, in any way possible, <a href="../join">just join and come talk to us!</a> We even have a special channel for you: #contributors.
          <br>Oh, and one more thing. If you hold any cryptocurrency, you know that securing your keys is paramount. The Giveth core team uses the Ledger Nano S and by ordering yours via this <a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/d663?path=/products/ledger-nano-s">link</a> Giveth will receive a donation worth 15% of the cost. Protect yourself and support our cause!
